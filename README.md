# Illuminated Levels

A minimalist web experience featuring an illuminated panel that transitions through different color states. The project simulates a translucent plastic panel with internal illumination, creating an ambient light installation effect.

## Levels

- **Level 1**: Static white illumination
- **Level 2**: Red/White alternating (1 second intervals)
- **Level 3**: Red/Blue/White sequence (0.5 second intervals)
- **Level 4**: Red/Blue rapid alternation (0.25 second intervals)

## Usage

Simply open `index.html` in a web browser. Use the arrow buttons at the bottom of the screen to navigate between levels.

## Technical Details

The project uses pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without any dependencies. The illuminated effect is achieved through a combination of:
- Layered box shadows
- Color transitions
- Screen blend modes
- Subtle surface reflections
